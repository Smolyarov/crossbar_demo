Assumptions:
	Any slave can process one transaction at a time, for all slaves processing times are equal.
	
---------------------------------
+Reset behavior:
	sif and mif outputs are zero the next cycle
	
+One master sends tx to a slave (r/w):
	verify that if master sends repeat tx to the same slave before ack for the 1st tx is returned, that repeat tx gets ignored

Few masters send txs to the same slave (r/w) the same cycle:
	!!! verify that if no txs in queue for the slave, rr_cnt sets to the master with the lowest number (line 100)
	
Few masters send txs to the same slave (r/w) on sequential cycles:
	verify correct round-robin order
	
Few masters send txs to different slaves (r/w) the same cycle:

One master sends a few txs(r) one after another to a few slaves:
	verify that the return order is correct

---------------------------------------

TODO:
	each master in tb must block until transaction is complete
	next_tx_valid[i] = 000 means no valid transactions ahead. wtf
